## What does this folder include 
This folder contains notebooks used to assess the consistency between various DEM/DSM from different data sources, e.g. Elvis (GA) and the AGO Labs. Each notebook starts with the name of the study area, e.g. Launceston, Wagga. Taking Launceston as an example:  

- [launceston_0_data_prep.ipynb](launceston_0_data_prep.ipynb): Prepare mosaic DEM/DSM rasters and filter ground control points data.      

- [launceston_1_dem_at_gcp.ipynb](launceston_1_dem_at_gcp.ipynb): Compare elevation values from DEM/DSM and ground control data.     

* Similar exploration has been conducted for the other sites (e.g. Wagga, Tweed Heads) except that not all DEM/DSM are available for all sites.
